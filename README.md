This is a dummy food-ordering app made to test out different code techniques and libraries.

The initial version is done with `Angular` and `shadcn/ui`, but other versions may be available as branches.

The design is roughly based on https://dribbble.com/shots/15082603-Food-Delivery-Dashboard, with custom tweaks here and there.
